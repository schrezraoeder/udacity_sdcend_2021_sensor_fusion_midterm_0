# ID_S3_EX2

# this file is basically loop_over_dataset.py again but with all the settings set as per the instructions 
# at the start of rubric point ID_S3_EX2 as specified in the Udacity Classroom so we do not have to manually
# set all those configurations in loop_over_dataset but can just run this file when we are working on that 
# rubric point.
